Responses to the referee report is as follows,
\\

Firstly, we thank the anonymous referee again for providing helpful suggestions. We have revised our manuscript cautiously in terms of the referee report, with new revisions marked in boldface. Below, we give a detailed description of our revisions.

COMMENT:
\\
(1) First of all, the definition of $\gamma'$ is unclear. Abstract and Introduction say $\rho_{tot} \propto r^{-\gamma'}$ and an isothermal profile corresponds to $\gamma'$ = 2. However this is inconsistent with Eq. (4.3) in which $\gamma'$ = 1 reduces to an isothermal case. This is important because the  interpretation of $\gamma_{out}/\gamma_{in}$ shown e.g., Fig. 7 is different between $\gamma'$ = 2 and $\gamma'$ = 1 (as $\bigtriangleup \gamma'$ = 0.02 translates into $\bigtriangleup (\gamma'_{out}/\gamma'_{in})$ = 0.01 and 0.02, respectively).
\\
RESPONSE:
\\
We thank the referee for catching this. We have fixed the inconsistent
definition in Eq 4.3 and switched to absolute errors on $\gamma'$
throughout in order to avoid any confusion.
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(2) It is mentioned that the Gaussian PSFs are adopted for Euclid,
WFIRST, and LSST. I'm a little bit concerned about this, because PSFs
are known to be more extended that Gaussian (particularly for space
observations). They are better described by the Moffat profile. Is
this difference of the PSF not important? In fact it looks
straightforward to repeat the analysis for several different PSF
shapes (different $\beta$ in the Moffat profile for example) to check
this effect.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\
We have simulated the effect of using a Moffat profile in the case of
WFIRST. This is the most promising of the surveys where we are
adopting Gaussian PSFs, and therefore the most likely where our
conclusions could have been affected negatively. As one can see from
the additional Table~6, the broader wings of a Moffat PSF decrease
only slightly the precision on $\gamma'$. We thank the referee for
pushing us to this further test, which improves our paper.

COMMENT
\\
(3) I should note that Kochanek et al. (2001) is among the first who emphasized the importance of lensed host galaxies for time delay cosmography and demonstrated how it breaks the degeneracy in lens mass models.

\\
COMMENT:
\\
(4) Throughout the paper the authors ignore the PSF uncertainty and assume the perfect knowledge about the PSF. While I understand the authors' point that by doing so the results represent a lower limit of the total uncertainty, I'd like to see a more extensive discussion on how the PSF uncertainty would propagate into $\gamma'$, given the critical importance of accurate PSF characterizations for AO observations. In Introduction the authors mention Marshall et al. and Lagattuta et al., but these papers are not very relevant in this context as systems studied in those papers are more like galaxy-galaxy strong lensing. In the case of quasar lensing, there must be a degeneracy between the PSF wing (from quasar images) and surface brightness profile of a lensed host galaxy, which has to be carefully addressed. Agnello et al. mentioned in the paper did not fully take account of the PSF uncertainty. In a recent paper by Rusu et al. (2015) adopted a parametrized PSF model and marginalized over PSF parameters when deriving physical parameters, and thus should be helpful in discussing potential impacts of PSF uncertainties and possible future extensions of the present paper to address the propagation of PSF uncertainties to the final result.
\\
RESPONSE:
\\ 
This is of course an important issue. One, however, that cannot be
quantitatively addressed using studies in the literature (The Rusu et
al paper for example does not attempt to determine $\gamma'$, and
furthermore the situation with Subaru might be completely different
from Keck or TMT). Addressing the issue quantitatively would require a
full suite of simulations that would be specific for every instrument
configruration and well beyond the scope of the aims of this
paper. While we agree that this is a worthwile enterprise we think
that this is best left for a future follow-up paper, so as not to
detract from the main goal of this paper, that is the estimation of
the random uncertainties. We clarified our goal of focusing on the
random component of the error at several points in the paper, starting
from the introduction and adding a full paragraph at the end.
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(5) In Sec. 3.1: ``... of currently known lenses, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,'' The current largest quasar lens sample comes from the SDSS Quasar Lens Search, containing more than 50 quasar lenses. It would be informative to give a quantitative description of the SQLS sample (typical magnitudes, quad/double ratio, etc), citing references.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

-------------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(6) Also in Sec. 3.1: ``As in the real-system used as inspiration'' This sounds a bit odd, because SLACS and SL2S (which that sentence is referring) are not quasar lens surveys but galaxy-galaxy strong lens surveys. For example typical redshifts can be quite different.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\
We rephrased the paragraph to clarify what we meant. We meant that the
redshifts are reasonable and in the end it does not matter what they
are exactly.

------------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(7) Sec 3.2: ``... are listed in Table 2 and Table 3.'' In fact light and lens models are described later in Sec. 4, so at this point readers have no idea what these parameters mean.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

------------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(8) The authors choose a quasar 1 mag brighter than the host galaxy in their simulations. It would be useful to check previous analysis of lensed quasar hosts to see how typical this assumption is compared with observed lensed quasar systems. For example Peng et al. (2006) analyzed a large sample of quasar lenses using HST. Rusu et al. (2015) mentioned above also added several more quasar lens systems with host detections.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

-----------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(9) Is the quasar always placed at the center of the host galaxy? This may sound obvious, but looking at Fig. 4 lensed quasar host appears to be offseted from the quasar image. Of course this is not impossible, as a nice example was given in Agnello et al., but this kind of configuration is also not very common.
\\
RESPONSE:
\\
Yes, the quasar is always at the center of the galaxy, within numerical accuracy. The quasar images are added directly in the image plane and their position, given the center of the host galaxy in the source plane, are compute using gravlens. The configuration in Figure 4 happens because the host surface brightness profile crosses into the inner caustic very close to the center of the galaxy, but not exactly.
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(10) It looks like lensing galaxies are not shown in Figs. 3-6, I guess this is just to better show quasar images and host galaxies. If so this point should be clearly mentioned in the paper. In practice a lensing galaxy is fitted simultaneously (if I understand correctly), so it may be helpful to show simulated images with lensing galaxies as well.
\\
RESPONSE:
\\
Yes, the referee is correct that the lensing galaxy is fitted
simultaneously. Unfortunately, it is difficult to render the host
galaxy at the same time as the host on a b/w image. So the images with
the lens galaxies are not very informative, and would take up a lot of
space, effectively doubling the real estate covered by figures
3-6. For the sake of conciseness we prefer to only show the figures
that contain the most information.
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(11) In the non-linear fitting described in Sec. 4.2, is the sky level not included as a fitting parameter? Or the sky level is fixed to the true value during fitting?
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

---------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(12) In Sec. 4.3 and 5 there are sentences like ``determine $\gamma'$
with 2\% precision''. This is related to my first comment, suppose
that the input $\gamma'$ value is 2, ``2\% precision'' is different
from $\gamma'$ uncertainties of 0.02. If one wants to determine H0
with 2\% accuracy, $\gamma'$ has to be deter- mined with an accuracy
of 0.02, which corresponds to 1\% precision of $\gamma'$ determination
for the fiducial $\gamma'$ value of 2. Please clarify.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

---------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(13) In Sec. 5: ``we generate 30 mock systems'' These mock systems refer to different noise realizations of the same input image?
\\

RESPONSE:
\\

---------------------------------------------------------------
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(14) Figs. 7-10: I don't quite understand the insert in each panel. If
I read the caption literally, x and y axes refer to the same quantity
and therefore all the points lie exactly on the $y = x$ line? Then
what information does this plot carry?
\\
RESPONSE:
We have removed the inset with redundant information.
\\
\\
COMMENT:
\\
(15) It would be very useful to add a summary table that lists all the
estimated uncertainties on $\gamma'$, as it is sort of painful to read
off those values from the Figures.
\\

RESPONSE:
\\
We have added the table.
